To clean the file I used a ruby script to replace everything that doesn't match a
regular expression with a space. So I would have predictible spacing, if several
characters matched in a row I replaced it with a single space. Now I can read each
word as separated by a space. Note that this counts contractions as two words (for
instance, they and (a)ll count as 2 separate words in this implemntation)

The program took about an hour to write. I had the most trouble getting the keys from
the max value, as you have to iterate over the entire keyset.

I get the following results.

Alice: 396
Rabbit: 45
Cheshire: 7
Mad: 1
Hatter: 55
