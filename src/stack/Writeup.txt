It took me 3 hours to write this code from scratch, the junit test, the build
file, and the script to change the junit test into a standalone test, and the
automated git commit and package creation. 

I wrote the linked stack version first, and was able to write it with only 3 syntax
errors (amazing cause I'm just learning java). The array stack I had more errors,
including a curious null pointer exception as I was adding to size during the
loop. It took getting out the debugger to track down the error by stepping through
the code. This probably took 30 minutes or more to track down the one error.

The code works, and the assignment was very easy. It would be much more interesting
more challenging to implement a method to return the max element, evaluate an RPN
expression, test for correct nesting of ([<"">]), evaluate a directory tree/path
name, etc and actually use the data structure. I thought of implementing these
for entertainment, but had too much math homework.
